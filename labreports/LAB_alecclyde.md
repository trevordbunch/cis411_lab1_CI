# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
This file tells CircleCI how to configure their processes to work with our project. It can also store network preferences that allow the connection to happen because both programs are on the same page when it comes to settings. A .yml file is in a language that is easy to translate to other languages.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
   Orbs: "Reusable snippets of code that help automate processes
   Workflows:
   Jobs:

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
   

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
