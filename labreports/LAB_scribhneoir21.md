# Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
This config file seems to outline things for CircleCI to do once an update occurs in a repository. CircleCI's documentation states that it will run the jobs (build in our config file) in seperate VMs.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
Version denotes the circle CI version
Jobs houses the seperate jobs to be run. Our file only has build, but test is another common job.
Within build, we have the steps it will run inside the VM. This can run basic commands (i.e. run: yarn install) or do more complex things (I assume whatever is being done with docker)

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
If it is sucessful, all of the steps within each job have run sucessfully. All tests have passed, any configured deployments were performed, etc.
   

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
I would add a deployment enviornment and maybe add a test job.
